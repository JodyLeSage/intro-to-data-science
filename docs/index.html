                    ## What is data science?
                    
                    Note:
                    Data science is an overloaded term.  Depending on who you talk to a "data scientist" can be anywhere from a person who is good with Excel all the way up to an engineer that designs and manages massively parallel computations.  I prefer to view data science as an interdisciplinary field that is focused on extrating knowledge (something that has meaning) from data (doesn't have explicit meaning)

                    This is a famous or rather infamous venn diagram from data scientist, Drew Conway.  I bring it up as a sort of warning for what you might get out of this talk.  I imagine most of you fall somewhere adjacent to this "Danger Zone" between computer skills and domain knowledge.  I'm going to try to keep this talk light on the mathematics, but just keep in mind that if you have arrived at a conclusion and you don't understand how that solution works, your work is not yet done.  We will see some examples later of some common statistical pitfalls to help you stay out of the "danger zone."
