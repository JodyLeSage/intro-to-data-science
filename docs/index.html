                    ## What is data science?
                    
                    Note:
                    Data science is an overloaded term.  Depending on who you talk to a "data scientist" can be anywhere from a person who is good with Excel all the way up to an engineer that designs and manages massively parallel computations.  I prefer to view data science as an interdisciplinary field that is focused on extracting knowledge (something that has meaning) from data (doesn't have explicit meaning)

						Instead of an outline for this talk, I'd like to show you this venn diagram from Drew Conway, notable data scientist.  I haven't met many of you, but I imagine most of you fit somewhere in this "Hacking Skills" circle.  My goal for this talk is to cover some math and statistics to steer you away from this "Danger Zone."  At the same time, I know statistics isn't everyone's strong suit. Basically I'm hoping to give you some hands-on demos that will improve your intuition about how to approach a data science problem and that will hopefully steer you towards these data science and machine learning sections.

					## The Classification Problem
					
					Note:
					There are many types of problems you can solve with data science, but this talk is only going to focus on one: the classification problem.  For those of you who are not already familiar with it, you're essentially trying to predict which label should be applied to a piece of data based on other piece of data you've seen in the past. The classic example is, of course, image recognition.  You show an angorithm 1000 pictures of cats and 1000 pictures of dogs - this is called the learning phase. Then you take a new picture of an animal and you ask your algorithm "is this a picture of a cat or a dog?" - this is called the prediction phase.  And you hope your algorithm can label the pictures.
