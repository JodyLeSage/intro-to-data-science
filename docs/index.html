                    ## What is data science?
                    
                    Note:
                    Data science is an overloaded term.  Depending on who you talk to a "data scientist" can be anywhere from a person who is good with Excel all the way up to an engineer that designs and manages massively parallel computations.  I prefer to view data science as an interdisciplinary field that is focused on extracting knowledge (something that has meaning) from data (doesn't have explicit meaning)

						Instead of an outline for this talk, I'd like to show you this venn diagram from Drew Conway, notable data scientist.  I haven't met many of you, but I imagine most of you fit somewhere in this "Hacking Skills" circle.  My goal for this talk is to cover some math and statistics to steer you away from this "Danger Zone."  At the same time, I know statistics isn't everyone's strong suit. Basically I'm hoping to give you some hands-on demos that will improve your intuition about how to approach a data science problem and that will hopefully steer you towards these data science and machine learning sections.
